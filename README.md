### Python for machine learning:
- Python is a popular and powerful general purpose programming language that recently emerged as the preferred language among data scientists. 
- However, there are a lot of modules and libraries already implemented in Python, that can make your life much easier. 
libraries:
1. The first package is NumPy which is a math library to work with N-dimensional arrays in Python. It enables you to do computation efficiently and effectively. 
2. SciPy is a collection of numerical algorithms and domain specific toolboxes, including signal processing, optimization, statistics and much more. SciPy is a good library for scientific and high performance computation.
3. Matplotlib is a very popular plotting package that provides 2D plotting, as well as 3D plotting.
4. Pandas library is a very high-level Python library that provides high performance easy to use data structures. It has many functions for data importing, manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and timeseries.
5. SciKit Learn is a collection of algorithms and tools for machine learning which is our focus here and which you'll learn to use within this course.

#### Unsupervised learning:

* Generally speaking, unsupervised learning has more difficult algorithms than supervised learning since we know little to no information about the data, or the outcomes that are to be expected.
