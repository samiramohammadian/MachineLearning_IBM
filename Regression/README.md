# Regression 
week2

##  introduction to regression: 
 
- Regression is the process of preicting a continuous value . 
- In regression there are two types of variables: a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
  - The dependent variable can be seen as the state, target, or final goal we study and try to predict. (Y)
  - independent variables, also known as explanatory variables, can be seen as the causes of those states. (X)

+ The key point in the regression is that our dependent value should be continuous and cannot be a discrete value. However, the independent variable, or variables, can be measured on either a categorical or continuous measurement scale. 

- Type of Regression model : 

  - Simple Regression: 
    - Simple Linear Regression
    -  Simple Non-Linear Regression
    -  
  - Multiple Regression:  --> be more than an independent comparison in the process
    - Multiple Linear Regression
    - Multiple Non-Linear Regression
